Hard work,  effective leadership,   consistent   funding,   strategic\npartnerships and implementation of evidence-based innovative interventions have\nsignificantly contributed towards this progress. As a country, we always strive towards\nresponding directly to new trends in the HIV epidemic and ensuring that we have\nclient-centric approaches that meet the needs of our clients and communities in their\njourney to good health.\nResults of \u2018The Zimbabwe Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (ZIMPHIA 2020)\u2019\nindicate that 86.8% of people living with HIV in Zimbabwe now know their status, a 10%\nincrease from the previous survey in 2015. 97% of people living with HIV are now on\nlifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART), signifying yet another improvement from the previ-\nous 88.4% recorded in the last ZIMPHIA. For those on antiretroviral therapy, 90.3% of\nthem have achieved viral load suppression, compared to 85.3% in the previous survey.\n", "content_type": "text", "score": null, "meta": {}, "id_hash_keys": ["content"], "embedding": null, "id": "294e2ef3a2c28054d1c062cd2d9e9b78"}, {"content": "For those on antiretroviral therapy, 90.3% of\nthem have achieved viral load suppression, compared to 85.3% in the previous survey.\nAs a country, we are currently rolling out recency testing to track and trace where the\nrecent infections are emerging from in terms of geographic location as well as other\ndemographics such as age, sex and other key factors. This innovation gives us a clear\nbird\u2019s eye view and perspective of incident HIV infections and how we can\ncollaboratively work together with other line ministries, private sector, partners, funders\nas well as our communities and curb the new infections.\nGuided by our new \u2018Zimbabwe Health Sector HIV and STI Strategy: 2021 \u2013 2025\u2019, the\nMinistry of Health and Child Care will continue to strengthen integration of our HIV\nprevention, treatment and care initiatives to strive towards an HIV-free generation.

If you suspect an adverse reaction, consider stop-\nping the medicine or reduce the dosage as soon possible and please report the adverse\ndrug reaction to the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ).\nAll reports of serious events should be followed up if details are incomplete.

Overall, HIV prevention, care and treatment communications in\nZimbabwe lack a robust comprehensive and integrated advocacy and\ncommunications strategy addressing key barriers and motivators at\nvarious stages of clients\u2019 health journeys. Whilst the Voluntary Medical\nMale Circumcision (VMMC) programme has a communications strategy,\nit is a standalone strategy with no clear linkages to other HIV prevention\nstrategies such as the Comprehensive Condom Programme (CCP) or HIV\nTesting Services (HTS). The VMMC strategy does provide best practices\nand guidance for a client-centred approach, developed using participatory\nand human-centred design by reviewing audience segmentation and the\nclient\u2019s journey.

Situation and Behavioural Analysis\nHIV prevalence among female sex workers in\nZimbabwe is 57.1%, which is nearly five times\nthe rate of the general population.8 There are\nan estimated 4,000 new HIV infections among\nFSWs annually.35 In Zimbabwe, 30% of men\naged 30-49, 25% of married men and 19% of\nmen with secondary or more education reported\nhaving sex with a commercial sex worker.33\nSex workers and their clients are at high risk of\nHIV due to the large number and rapid change\nof sexual partners, high rates of STIs, dry sex\nand sex during menses.34 Other contributing\nfactors include unsafe working conditions and\nviolence (by law enforcement officials, intimate\npartners and clients), the inability to negotiate\ncondom use, social stigma and discrimination\nand criminalised work environments.35 Public\nand private humiliation are significant challenges\nfor sex workers that prevent them from seeking\nhealth care services and support from their\ncommunities.36\nThe HIV care cascade for FSWs is lagging\nbehind the general population as only 64% of\nthose living with HIV know their status, 68%\nof those who know their status are currently\non treatment and 77% of those on treatment\nare virally suppressed.

Other financial limitations are\naccess to condoms and medications. Often\nsex workers do not have enough condoms\nto match the number of clients. Moreover,\ndespite antiretrovirals (ARVs) being provided\nfor free, the transport costs and user fees (e.g.\ncouncil clinics) required are enough to make\nthe medications unaffordable and inaccessible.\nDue to economic conditions and the lack of\nemployment opportunities,34 many women feel\nstuck in sex work even if they would like to have\nthe opportunity for other forms of work.\nHealth Care Services\nMany sex workers use local clinics in\nemergencies only\u2014they prefer clinics specific\nfor sex workers as they feel more understood.

However, the core component that makes\nthis strategy truly unique is not that it may be the first nor that it involved so\nmany stakeholders. What makes this strategy different is the driving force\nbehind its entire contents: the individual people of Zimbabwe. Using a human-\ncentred design approach allowed for an empathetic and thorough analysis of\nthe complex nature of people\u2019s lives.

The emergence\nof the coronavirus since January 2020 will further\nconstrain domestic and global fiscal space for\nhealth, thereby limiting the ability of funders to\nincrease funding over the next five years.\nTo address these challenges, the country\u2019s\nHealth Financing Strategy emphasises technical\nand allocative efficiencies in utilising available\nresources while exploring options for innovative\nfinancing options. Current domestic financing for\nHIV through the AIDS Levy is less than 20% of the\ntotal funds, while external funding contributes\nthe largest share of 80%.

However, currency challenges\nsince 2018 have negatively affected the value of\nrevenue raised from the fund, especially for the\nimportation of drugs and commodities.

These efficiencies\ncan be unlocked at various levels including\nstrategic, governance and operational levels.\nValue-based and cost-efficient approaches are\nneeded by both the government, development\nand private sectors.
