Hard work,  effective leadership,   consistent   funding,   strategic\npartnerships and implementation of evidence-based innovative interventions have\nsignificantly contributed towards this progress. As a country, we always strive towards\nresponding directly to new trends in the HIV epidemic and ensuring that we have\nclient-centric approaches that meet the needs of our clients and communities in their\njourney to good health.\nResults of \u2018The Zimbabwe Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (ZIMPHIA 2020)\u2019\nindicate that 86.8% of people living with HIV in Zimbabwe now know their status, a 10%\nincrease from the previous survey in 2015. 97% of people living with HIV are now on\nlifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART), signifying yet another improvement from the previ-\nous 88.4% recorded in the last ZIMPHIA. For those on antiretroviral therapy, 90.3% of\nthem have achieved viral load suppression, compared to 85.3% in the previous survey.\n",
