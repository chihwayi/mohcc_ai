    "completion": "Reports should include: all ADRs to marketed medicines or Essential Medicines List items, all serious reactions and interactions, known and unknown ADRs, unusual reactions, reactions to traditional/herbal remedies, suspected contamination, questionable stability, defective components, poor packaging or labeling, and therapeutic failures."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the steps for reporting a suspected ADR?",
    "completion": "The steps include: 1) Obtain patient history and conduct full examination, 2) Check the known pharmacology of the medicine, 3) Manage the ADRs including consideration of dechallenge and rechallenge. Each step involves detailed assessment and documentation of findings."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are dechallenge and rechallenge in ADR management?",
    "completion": "Dechallenge refers to stopping a drug after an adverse event, with positive dechallenge meaning the adverse events disappear after stopping. Rechallenge refers to restarting the same medicine after stopping, with positive rechallenge meaning the adverse events recur after restarting. Rechallenge is only justified when benefits outweigh risks."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the key components of a complete ADR case report?",
    "completion": "A complete case report includes: description of adverse events with onset timing, product therapy details, patient characteristics, diagnosis documentation, clinical course and outcomes, therapeutic measures and lab data, response to dechallenge/rechallenge, and any other relevant information."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can healthcare workers minimize the occurrence of ADRs?",
    "completion": "ADRs can be minimized by: using few medicines when possible, using familiar medicines, avoiding unnecessary therapy changes, using reference materials, careful monitoring of high-risk medicines, being aware of drug-food interactions, reviewing all patient medicines regularly, and taking extra care with vulnerable populations like children, elderly, and pregnant women."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the benefits of reporting ADRs for healthcare workers and patients?",

  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is the first step in examining a patient with a suspected ADR and what does it involve?",
    "completion": "The first step is to obtain patient history and conduct a full examination. This includes taking a comprehensive medicine and medical history, conducting physical examination (as some medicines produce distinctive physical signs), establishing time relationships from therapy start to reaction onset, and determining other possible causes for symptoms including underlying disease, other medicines, or toxins."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What should healthcare workers consider when checking the pharmacology of a medicine suspected of causing an ADR?",
    "completion": "They should check if the reaction is known to occur with the particular medicine as stated in the package insert or other reference. However, it's important to note that if the reaction is not documented in the package insert, it doesn't mean that the reaction cannot occur with that particular medicine."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How should follow-up of ADR reports be handled?",
    "completion": "All reports of serious events should be followed up if details are incomplete, potentially requiring trained health professionals in clinical settings. Follow-up requests should be minimal to avoid discouraging reporting. Follow-up information might include essential missing details, outcome information, rechallenge results, laboratory tests, and post-mortem results where applicable."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What protections are in place for health workers who report ADRs?",
    "completion": "ADR reports do not constitute an admission that a health professional contributed to the event. Reporter details, health professionals named, and patient information are removed before sharing. Information is not used for commercial purposes but for improving ADR detection, case management, causality assessment, and patient safety."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What feedback can reporters expect after submitting an ADR report?",
    "completion": "The pharmacovigilance centre (MCAZ) provides feedback to all ADR reporters. Additional feedback information is provided after causality assessment by the MCAZ PVCT Committee."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What special considerations should be taken when prescribing medicines to prevent ADRs?",
    "completion": "Extra care should be taken when prescribing to children, the elderly, pregnant and nursing women, the seriously ill, and patients with hepatic and renal diseases. Careful ongoing monitoring is essential in these patients. Additionally, extra caution is needed with medicines known to have many interactions and adverse reactions like anticoagulants, hypoglycemics, and drugs affecting the CNS."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What features are available in the MCAZ online and mobile app medicines and vaccines safety system?",
    "completion": "The ePV system includes local built-in site reporting tracking, causality assessment, and the ability to upload de-identified and anonymized ADR reports to the WHO Drug International Monitoring Program VigiBase database for disproportionate analysis signal detection, VigiRank, and quality analysis known as VigiGrade completeness score."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "When should an ADR report be submitted to MCAZ?",
    "completion": "An ADR report should be submitted to MCAZ as soon as possible after the reaction occurs. It's better not to wait for final results and information such as hospital letters, as the report may be forgotten. Additional details can be sent to MCAZ later."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What role do laboratory tests play in ADR investigation?",
    "completion": "Laboratory tests are especially important if the medicine is considered essential in improving patient care or if the lab test results will improve management of the patient. Tests like FBC, ALT, and U & E may be conducted to help determine possible causes for new symptoms."
  },

  },
  {
    "prompt": "What should healthcare workers do if a patient shows unexplained signs or symptoms?",
    "completion": "If a patient shows signs and/or symptoms not clearly explained by the course of their illness, healthcare workers should think of adverse drug reaction. If an adverse reaction is suspected, consider stopping the medicine or reducing the dosage as soon as possible and report the adverse drug reaction to MCAZ."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What offline capabilities are available in the MCAZ reporting system?",
    "completion": "The mobile and desktop applications have offline functionality, meaning reports can be completed offline, saved, and submitted later when internet is available."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What precautions should be taken regarding medicine interactions?",
    "completion": "Healthcare workers should be aware of medicine interactions not only with other medicines but also with certain foodstuffs, alcohol, and even household chemicals.
